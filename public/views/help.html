<h4>Accessing Geometries</h4>
Geometries can be accessed in the <em>Editor</em> environment by using the <strong>g</strong> object. If you look at the <em>Geometries</em> tab, you can view and change the name of any feature you've drawn or added.

<h4>Styling Geometries</h4>
Geometries will be styled using Leaflet's style options. To set styles in the <em>Editor</em>, add leaflet style options to a feature's properties:

<pre class='prettyprint'>
g.feature1.properties.color = "#ff00ff";
g.feature1.properties.weight = 2;
</pre>
